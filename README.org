** Formulas

   To register a tap in Homebrew do:

   #+begin_src bash :results verbatim
     brew tap pgpbpadilla/pgpb 
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

*** GnuPG 2.2.41

    Background:
    
    1. After running an upgrade with =homebrew=, the package =gnupg=
       was upgraded to the latest stable version: 2.4
    2. =gnupg@2.4= introduces changes that breaks Emac's EasyPG:
       - google: emacs org gpg hangs:
         https://stackoverflow.com/q/76388376/400544 
       - =BEGIN_ENCRYPTION= status output happens later in 2.4.1 (breaks
         Emacs's EasyPG): https://dev.gnupg.org/T6481
    3. In my private computer I was able to downgrade to 2.2.41, which
       made everything work, thanks to
       https://stackoverflow.com/a/76404609/400544
    4. a couple of weeks later, my work computer broke too, same
       scenario, =brew upgrade= installed =gnupg@2.4.1=
    5. uninstalled 2.4.1
    6. installed =brew install =gnupg@2.2=, however, this time the
       version installed was not 2.2.41 but 2.2.42 which is also
       broken
    7. since minor versions are not versioned formulas, i.e., they
       don't show when you do:
       #+begin_src bash 
         brew search gnupg
       #+end_src

       #+RESULTS:
       : gnupg
       : gnupg-pkcs11-scd
       : gnupg@1.4
       : gnupg@2.2
       : pgpbpadilla/pgpb/gnupg@2.2.41
       : gnu-go
    8. I ended up creating [[file:Formula/gnupg@2.2.41.rb][this formula]] to install =gnupg@2.2.41=
       
       

*** Midnight Commander
    
    This Homebrew tap started with the need to install of Midnight
    Commander (MC) that is free from the bug described in [#4356: Subshell
    returns to panels view on key press (any
    key).](http://midnight-commander.org/ticket/4356)

    **Beware that this tap will install a very old version of MC.**

    To install MC, simply do:

    #+begin_src bash
      brew tap pgpbpadilla/pgpb brew info
      pgpbpadilla/pgpb/midnight-commander brew install
      pgpbpadilla/pgpb/midnight-commander
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
