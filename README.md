# Homebrew tap: pgpb

This Homebrew tap started with the need to install of Midnight Commander that is free 
from the bug described in 
[#4356: Subshell returns to panels view on key press (any key).](http://midnight-commander.org/ticket/4356)

**Beware that the installed version is very old.**

To install MC, simply do:

```bash
brew tap pgpbpadilla/pgpb
brew info pgpbpadilla/pgpb/midnight-commander
brew install pgpbpadilla/pgpb/midnight-commander
```
